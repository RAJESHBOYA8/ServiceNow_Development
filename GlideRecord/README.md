# ðŸ“‚ GlideRecord Script â€“ Fetch Incidents with Category 'Software'

This script demonstrates how to use **GlideRecord** in ServiceNow to query and display incident records where the category is set to `'software'`.

---

## ðŸ“œ Script

```javascript
var incidentRecord = new GlideRecord("incident"); // Create GlideRecord object for the 'incident' table
incidentRecord.addQuery('category', 'software');  // Add filter: category = 'software'
incidentRecord.query();                           // Execute the query

while (incidentRecord.next()) {                   // Loop through matching records
    gs.info("incident numbers are: " + incidentRecord.number);
}
ðŸ§  What is GlideRecord?
